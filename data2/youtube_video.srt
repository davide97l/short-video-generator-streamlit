1
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:06,600
 One so child came to visit his grandfather during his summer holidays.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,300
 He used to play with his grandpa all the time.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,500
 One day he said to his grandpa,

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,340
 When I grow up, I want to become a successful man.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,380
 Can you tell me some ways to be successful?

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:20,940
 Grandfather nodded.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,160
 Yes.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,400
 And took the boy with him to a nearby nursery.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,260
 From nursery, his grandpa bought two small plants and came back home.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,520
 Then he planted one plant in a pot and kept it inside the house

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,160
 and planted another one outside the house.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,500
 What do you think?

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,900
 Which of these two plants will grow better in future?

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,780
 Grandfather asked the boy.

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,920
 Boy, kept thinking for some time and then said,

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,660
 The plant inside the house will grow better

17
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:55,320
 because it is safe from every danger

18
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,860
 while the plant outside is at risk of many things

19
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:04,800
 like strong sunlight, storms, animals, etc.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,900
 Grandfather smiled and said,

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,340
 Let's see what happens in future.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,880
 After that boy left with his parents.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,720
 After four years,

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,740
 Boy came to visit his grandfather again

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,900
 when the boy saw his grandfather.

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,500
 He said,

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,020
 Grandpa.

28
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,040
 Last time I asked you some ways to be successful,

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,080
 but you did not tell me anything.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,300
 But this time, you have to tell me,

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,200
 Grandfather smiled and said,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,320
 Sure.

33
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,000
 But first, let's take a look at plants that we bought a few years back.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,200
 Saying this,

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,760
 Grandfather took the boy to a place where he had planted a small plant in a pot.

36
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,900
 They saw that the plant had turned into a tree.

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,320
 Then he took the boy to look at the plant,

38
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,220
 which they had planted outside.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,140
 There they saw that a huge tree stood.

40
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,740
 Its branches spread far and wide,

41
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,840
 providing shade to passers-by.

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,000
 Now, Grandfather looked at the boy and asked,

43
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,280
 Tell me which plant grew more,

44
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
 which is more successful.

45
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,380
 Boy replied,

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,639
 The one we planted outside.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,500
 But Grandpa,

48
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,760
 How is this possible?

49
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,880
 That plant must have faced so many dangers,

50
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,960
 still it grew so big,

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,320
 Grandfather smiled and said,

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,180
 Yes, plants outside had to face many things,

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,280
 but dealing with problems had its benefits too.

54
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,700
 Plants outside had the freedom to spread their roots as much as they wanted.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,640
 Problems like storms made its roots stronger.

56
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,700
 Today it is so strong that a small storm

57
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,600
 cannot cause any harm to it.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,340
 Son,

59
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,420
 what I am about to tell you,

60
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
 always remember it.

61
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,660
 Then you will be successful in whatever you do in life.

62
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,080
 If you always make comfortable choices,

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,080
 then you will not be able to grow as you can.

64
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,160
 If you are ready to face this world,

65
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,860
 despite all the dangers,

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,340
 then no goal is impossible for you to achieve.

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,840
 Never think of problems as hurdles,

68
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,960
 but think of them as steps toward success.

69
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,120
 Boy took a long breath,

70
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,280
 and stared at the tree.

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,120
 And he understood his grandpa's words,

72
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,500
 obstacles which we consider enemies in life.

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,520
 The same obstacles make us stronger

74
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,760
 and more successful in life.

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,980
 Similarly,

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,320
 our life is like a great adventure,

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,820
 filled with twists and turns that might seem like

78
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,700
 obstacles blocking our path.

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,320
 But guess what?

80
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,260
 These obstacles are like puzzles waiting to be solved.

81
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,540
 Just think about.

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,040
 When you play a game,

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,520
 the fun part is figuring out how to overcome challenges.

84
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
 Life works the same way.

85
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,960
 Each hurdle you face is a chance to learn,

86
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,500
 grow, and become even stronger,

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,400
 so don't let these roadblocks discourage you.

88
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,000
 Embrace them,

89
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,340
 tackle them,

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,320
 and watch yourself level up in the game of life.

91
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,120
 You've got the skills,

92
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,200
 determination,

93
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,040
 and spirit to conquer anything that comes your way.

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,560
 Hope you gain some value from this story,

95
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,640
 and try to implement it in your life,

96
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,900
 and always keep rising.
